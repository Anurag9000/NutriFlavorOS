## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.10+)

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Environment variables setup in backend/.env
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend

```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Platform

### 🚀 Recommended: One-Command Launch
Run the master launch script from the project root. This handles DB verification, ML model status, and starts the stack:
```bash
python scripts/launch_system.py
```

### 🧠 ML Model Training
To train the neural networks with Early Stopping (patience=10, max epochs=10k):
```bash
python scripts/train_all_models.py
```

### Manual Start
**Backend:**
```bash
python -m backend.main
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
